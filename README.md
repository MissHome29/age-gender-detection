# age-gender-detection

Our project focuses on age and gender detection. Age and gender detection is one of the most popular research directions in the field of facial intelligent recognition in recent years. One excellent detection function can be used in commercial fields, such as in photo interactive software that is extremely popular with young people, or in real scenarios, such as helping public security systems to conduct investigations. In our project, we used the face images contained in Wikipedia as a database. We then built models of multiple dimensions, including deep learning models that have performed well in related industries these years, and traditional algorithms that are easy to adjust for us. We finally build the age and gender detection models with industry-competitive recognition accuracy. We believe that the models we build have great revenue potential and social value.

After applying several traditional machine learning methods, multilayer CNN, VGG, Inception and ResNet, we find ResNet method gives us highest test accuracy, with 96.6% of accuracy for gender and 59.2% of accuracy for age.
